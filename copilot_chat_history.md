Where the "sidebar" chat UI lives
VS Code (desktop):
Copilot Chat appears as a side panel or view inside VS Code. Look for "Copilot" or "Copilot Chat" in the Activity Bar (left vertical icons). It can appear as:
A sidebar view (click the Copilot icon).
A panel inside the "Chat" view or as a tab in the Side Bar.
Conversations are shown in a list inside that panel. Each conversation (session) is selectable and persists if you're signed in and have the feature enabled.


How to open the Copilot Chat in VS Code (step-by-step)
Ensure the GitHub Copilot extension(s) are installed:
"GitHub Copilot" and/or "GitHub Copilot Chat" extension.
Sign in (account icon in the lower-left or extension prompt).
Open the Activity Bar and look for the Copilot icon (it may be a document with a spark/robot). If you don't see it:
View → Appearance → Show Activity Bar must be enabled.
Or open Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and run "View: Toggle Side Bar" then search "Copilot: Open Chat" or "Copilot Chat: Show" (extension commands vary).
Once open, the left column will list conversations; click a conversation to view its transcript.

Troubleshooting if you can't find the Copilot Chat sidebar
Extensions:
Make sure "GitHub Copilot" and "GitHub Copilot Chat" are installed and up to date.
Sign-in / Licensing:
Confirm you're signed into the same GitHub account that has Copilot access. The chat pane may be hidden if not signed in.
Update VS Code:
An older VS Code or incompatible extension version can hide the Copilot Chat window; update VS Code and the extensions.
Command Palette:
Use Ctrl+Shift+P and search "Copilot" — this works even when the Activity Bar icon is missing.
Re-enable Views:
View → Appearance → Show Activity Bar and View → Appearance → Show Side Bar.
Conflicting extensions:
Some extensions or workspace settings may hide the Copilot view; try disabling other extensions or open a fresh window (File → New Window) then enable Copilot.
Enterprise network:
If you're behind a corporate firewall or using an enterprise account, Copilot Chat might be blocked or disabled by your org — check with your admin.
